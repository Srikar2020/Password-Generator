In this weeks Homework we were given a task to create a password generator with starter code to work with. I used java script to make a series of criteria for the password to work. When clicked the button to generate a password then there are series of prompts such as the password must be between 8 and 128 characters, or it must include character types like lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. 

When you answer the prompts/criteria pop up then the input should be validated and when selected the password is generated which matches the selected criteria. The password is written on the page. 

Great way for me to learn and use If statments, Variables, functions, loops, strings, booleans which were all utilized in the work I was able to accomplish.
